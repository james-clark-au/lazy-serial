# 1.2 (Apr 2024)

- Alternative dispatch_command() that will take a `const char *` and copy it somewhere mutable for the sake of later tokenisation.

# 1.1 (Apr 2024)

- Callbacks bumped to 20 (this needs to be made more dynamic...), buffer size bumped to 512 (c'mon, microcontrollers have heaps of space these days)
- Default help command can be changed.
- dispatch_command() made public so alternate sources of commands can be used.
- new run_script(const char\*) to dispatch a sequence of commands in bulk.

# 1.0 (2016)

- 10 commands are permitted, and buffer size is 64 bytes.
- Commands are automatically read from the Serial object supplied, and dispatched according to the registered callbacks.
